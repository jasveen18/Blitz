# Blitz
According to a survey, more than 70% of the youth population (15yrs - 30yrs) prefer  street food over food from restaurants or hotels. But when you travel to a different locality, it is difficult to find the best street food as it is not available on Zomato or Swiggy. To solve this problem here comes the BLITZ. With the help of BLITZ user can find the best street food as per their taste and location.

Moreover, it is a small contribution to promote all the street food vendors who has suffered huge losses due to Covid 19 because the charges to publish your stall on online food ordering websites is huge and they can't afford that.
